# Python Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Python Progress Tracker repository! This repository serves as an archive of my Python learning journey. Here you can find all the projects and exercises I've completed, and see how far I've come in my Python journey.

## Getting Started

To see my progress, just browse the repository and take a look at the different folders and files. Each folder corresponds to a particular project or exercise that I completed, and each file in the folder contains code that I created for that project or exercise.

## Participation

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for me. You can mention a bug in the repository and I'll address it right away. I'm always looking for ways to get better and improve my Python skills.

You can create a request for a fix if you want to contribute to this repository. Please be sure to explain what changes you made and why you think they would be a valuable addition to the repository.
